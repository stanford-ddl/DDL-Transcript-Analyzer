TOPIC = "ranked choice voting"\
\
"(Beta) For proposal: Implement RCV as an alternative method both to elected officials and representatives at all levels"\
\
prompt = """This is a list of arguments presented in a deliberation about """ + TOPIC + """. Your job is to summarize\
   these arguments into 7 distinct topics regarding """ + TOPIC + """ in a Python list of strings, with each string being a topic.\
   Every string MUST start with 'Ranked choice voting is' followed by a brief summary of the topic.\
   Do NOT number the list or indent in your response, and do NOT include apostrophes.\
   Do NOT include anything in the list other than the topics themselves. Your response is ONLY the list of topics.\
   Once again, the Python list you return should contain exactly 7 strings. This is an example of what you should return:\
   ['Ranked choice voting is fair', 'Ranked choice voting is complicated', 'Ranked choice voting is pointless'...]\
   The topics in the list should be somewhat distinct from each other.\
   You should not have broad topics, such as the advantages and disadvantages of """ + TOPIC + """. Rather,\
   you should instead find nuanced groups of arguments that may be present on either side of the discussion."""\
\
EVAL_PROMPT = """You are a skilled annotator tasked with identifying the type of arguments made in a deliberation about """ + TOPIC + """.\
        Read through the given arguments presented.\
        Your job is to extract the type of arguments made and load them into the JSON object containing true/false parameters.\
        \
        Return true for comparisonToCurrentSystem if the argument compares ranked choice voting to the current system.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting is more equitable than the current system that only allows for two dominant parties to win'.\
        Return false for comparisonToCurrentSystem otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for votingDecisions if the argument discusses the impact of ranked choice voting on voting decisions.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will allow voters to vote for their preferred candidate without fear of wasting their vote'.\
        Return false for votingDecisions otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for partyRepresentation if the argument discusses how ranked choice voting may impact party representation.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will allow for more third-party candidates to win elections'.\
        Return false for partyRepresentation otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for voterTurnout if the argument discusses how ranked choice voting may impact voter turnout.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will increase voter turnout and encourage more people to engage in elections.\
        Return false for voterTurnout otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for strategicVoting if the argument discusses how ranked choice voting may impact strategic voting.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will prevent people from voting for a candidate they don't like to avoid a worse outcome'.\
        Return false for strategicVoting otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for moderateCandidates if the argument discusses how ranked choice voting may impact moderate candidates.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will allow moderate candidates to win elections'. \
        Return false for moderateCandidates otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for moneyInPolitics if the argument discusses how ranked choice voting may impact money in politics.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will reduce the influence of money in politics'.\
        Return false for moneyInPolitics otherwise.\
        \
        Return true for other if the argument discusses a topic not covered by the other parameters.\
        For example, 'Ranked choice voting will make voting too complicated.'\
        \
        Return true for notRelevant if the argument is not relevant to the discussion of ranked choice voting.\
        For example, 'I have a dog and two kids.'\
        \
        It is possible for a single argument to have multiple true parameters, except for notRelevant.\
        If an argument is not relevant, all other parameters should be false.\
        You should return true for at least one parameter.\
