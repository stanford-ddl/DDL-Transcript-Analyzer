6. [C] Reason: This argument is not directly related to the proposal of changing the electoral college, as it focuses on concerns about registering with proper identification rather than the electoral college system itself.",,,"1. [A] Reason: Implementing term limits for Supreme Court Justices could potentially reduce the likelihood of fraud, as it would prevent any one Justice from holding power for an extended period of time and potentially abusing that power.
2. [B] Reason: Term limits could potentially create an incentive for Justices to engage in fraudulent behavior in order to secure a position on the Court before their term limit expires.
3. [C] Reason: The ease of registration for individuals with a computer is not directly related to the proposal of implementing term limits for Supreme Court Justices.

2. Encouragement of fraud - B Reason: Similarly to argument 1, less strict standards could encourage individuals to engage in fraudulent behavior knowing that the consequences may be less severe.
3. Ease of registration for individuals with a computer - A Reason: Less strict standards could make it easier for individuals with access to a computer to register to vote, potentially increasing voter turnout.
4. Lack of verification for real identity - B Reason: Less strict standards could result in a lack of verification for the real identity of voters, making it easier for individuals to vote under false pretenses.
5. Lack of verification for multiple registrations - B Reason: Less strict standards could lead to a lack of verification for multiple registrations by the same individual, potentially allowing for voter fraud.
6. Concerns about registering with proper identification - C Reason: This argument is not directly applicable to the proposal as it focuses on concerns about registering with proper identification, which may not necessarily be impacted by less strict voting standards.",,,"1. [A] Reason: Changing the primary system could potentially increase the potential for fraud if proper safeguards are not put in place.
2. [B] Reason: Changing the primary system could potentially encourage fraud if there are loopholes or lack of verification processes.
3. [A] Reason: Changing the primary system to one that allows for ease of registration for individuals with a computer could be seen as a pro as it increases accessibility and participation in the system.
4. [B] Reason: Lack of verification for real identity could be a con as it opens up the system to potential fraud and manipulation.
5. [B] Reason: Lack of verification for multiple registrations could also be a con as it could lead to individuals registering multiple times and skewing the results.
6. [C] Reason: Concerns about registering with proper identification may not be directly applicable to the proposal of changing the primary system, as it depends on the specific changes being proposed.",,,"1. [A] Reason: This argument is a con because it suggests that implementing more accessibility to voting could lead to increased potential for fraud.
2. [A] Reason: This argument is a con because it suggests that implementing more accessibility to voting could encourage fraud.

4. [A] Reason: This argument is a con because it points out the lack of verification for real identity, which could lead to potential issues with the voting process.
5. [A] Reason: This argument is a con because it highlights the lack of verification for multiple registrations, which could also contribute to potential fraud.
6. [C] Reason: This argument is not applicable because it raises concerns about registering with proper identification, which is a valid consideration but does not necessarily oppose the overall proposal of increasing accessibility to voting.",,,"1. [A] Reason: Implementing limits on financing individual candidates and parties can help reduce the potential for fraud by preventing large sums of money from influencing elections.
2. [B] Reason: Limiting financing could potentially encourage fraud as individuals and parties may seek alternative, illegal means to obtain funding.
3. [C] Reason: This argument is not directly applicable to the proposal as it focuses on ease of registration for voting, not financing.
4. [A] Reason: Implementing limits on financing could help address concerns about lack of verification for real identity by reducing the influence of anonymous donors.
5. [A] Reason: Limiting financing can help address concerns about lack of verification for multiple registrations by reducing the ability for individuals or entities to donate under different names.

[A] Reason: Implementing more measures to address voter fraud would potentially decrease the likelihood of fraud occurring, therefore this argument is in support of the proposal.
2. [B] Reason: This argument suggests that implementing more measures to address voter fraud could potentially encourage individuals to commit fraud, therefore it is against the proposal.
3. [C] Reason: This argument is not directly related to the proposal as it focuses on the ease of registration for individuals with a computer, rather than addressing voter fraud specifically.
4. [A] Reason: Lack of verification for real identity can lead to voter fraud, so implementing more measures to address this issue would be in support of the proposal.
5. [A] Reason: Lack of verification for multiple registrations can also contribute to voter fraud, so addressing this issue would be in support of the proposal.

2. [B] Reason: Allowing individuals with felony convictions to vote may encourage fraudulent behavior, as some may see this as an opportunity to manipulate the voting system.
3. [C] Reason: This argument is not directly applicable to the proposal, as it focuses on the ease of registration for individuals with a computer rather than the specific issue of restoring voting rights to individuals with felony convictions.
4. [A] Reason: Restoring voting rights to individuals with felony convictions may lead to a lack of verification for their real identity, potentially opening up opportunities for fraud.
5. [A] Reason: Allowing individuals with felony convictions to vote without proper verification could lead to multiple registrations and potential fraud.
6. [A] Reason: Concerns about registering with proper identification are relevant to the proposal, as restoring voting rights to individuals with felony convictions may raise questions about the verification process.",,,"1. [A] Reason: This argument is a con because increasing opportunities for learning about civic education in schools does not necessarily lead to increased potential for fraud. In fact, educating students about civic responsibilities and the importance of ethical behavior can help prevent fraud in the future.

2. [A] Reason: Similar to argument 1, the increase in public funding and financing could encourage individuals to engage in fraudulent activities in order to benefit from the additional resources available.
3. [C] Reason: The ease of registration for individuals with a computer is not directly related to the proposal of increasing public funding and financing for campaigns.
4. [A] Reason: The lack of verification for real identity could pose a risk in the context of increased public funding and financing for campaigns, as it may allow for individuals to falsely claim funds.
5. [A] Reason: Similarly, the lack of verification for multiple registrations could lead to misuse of public funds in campaigns if individuals are able to register multiple times without proper oversight.
6. [C] Reason: Concerns about registering with proper identification are not directly tied to the proposal of increasing public funding and financing for campaigns.",,,"1. [A] Reason: Implementing RCV can actually decrease the potential for fraud as it allows for a more accurate representation of voter preferences.
2. [B] Reason: RCV does not encourage fraud, as it is a method designed to ensure fair representation of voter preferences.
3. [C] Reason: This argument is not directly applicable to the proposal as it focuses on ease of registration, which is not the main focus of implementing RCV.
